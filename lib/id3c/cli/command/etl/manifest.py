"""
Process sample manifest records into the relational warehouse.

Manifest records are JSON documents in the ``receiving.manifest`` table which
have a sample barcode, an optional collection barcode, and other metadata.
These records are parsed out of spreadsheets into JSON documents using
``id3c manifest parse`` and received via ``id3c manifest upload``.  This ETL
command is the final step in creating/updating the samples in our data
warehouse.

Three separate, loosely-coupled commands let us build a pipeline to handle
different kinds of manifests with different data update strategies.  For
example, we can track the output of preparing the manifest and only receive new
or updated records.
