"""
Generate and upload REDCap DET notifications.

This command is useful for backfilling data entry trigger (DET) notifications
for project records which missed the normal trigger process.  Two common
scenarios when this happens are:

1. The records were created/modified before trigger was enabled.

\b
2. The records were imported via REDCap's API or mobile app, which
   bypasses the trigger.
