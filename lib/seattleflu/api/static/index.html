    <h2>Authentication</h2>

    <p>All routes require
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">Basic
    access authentication</a> over HTTPS unless otherwise noted.

    <h2>Request and response bodies</h2>

    <p>All routes which receive request bodies expect a Content-Type of
    <code>application/json</code> unless otherwise noted.

    <p>All request bodies must be encoded with UTF-8.  All response bodies are
    encoded with UTF-8 unless explicitly declared otherwise by a Content-Type
    header.

    <h2>Status codes</h2>

    <p>All routes use standard HTTP status codes.

    <p>If the Content-Type of a <code>400 Bad Request</code> response is
    <code>application/json</code>, then the body will be a JSON object with at
    least the key <code>error</code>.  Additional keys may provide more
    details.

    <h2>Routes</h2>

    <h3 class="code">POST /v1/receiving/enrollment</h3>
    <p>Stores the request data as an enrollment document in a receiving area of
    the study database. Accepts any JSON object.

    <h3 class="code">POST /v1/receiving/presence-absence</h3>
    <p>Stores the request data as presence/absence calls in a receiving area of
    the study database. Accepts any JSON object.
