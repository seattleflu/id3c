-- Hello!  All shipping views are defined here.  Rework this change with Sqitch
-- to change a view definition or add new views.  This workflow helps keep
-- inter-view dependencies manageable.

begin;

-- This view is versioned as a hedge against future changes.  Changing this
-- view in place is fine as long as changes are backwards compatible.  Think of
-- the version number as the major part of a semantic versioning scheme.  If
-- there needs to be a lag between view development and consumers being
-- updated, copy the view definition into v2 and make changes there.
